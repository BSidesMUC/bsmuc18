            <h3>Purpose and Scope</h3>
          </div>
          <p>The primary purpose of the BSidesMunich Code of Conduct is to provide the foundation for the inclusion of a diverse range of contributors and participants so that we can focus on exchanging ideas about security. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, academic background and religion (or lack thereof).</p>
          <p>We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and  guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.</p>

            <h3>Expected Behavior</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            <li>Participate! The conference goes from good to excellent when you actively engage with the people in the community and the conference subject matter.</li>
            <li>Think about how your speech and actions may affect others around you and exercise consideration and respect.</li>
            <li>We expect a healthy amount of scrutiny of conference subject matter. But, in cases of disagreement, attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>

            <h3>Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; harassment of these patrons of these venues is also unacceptable.</p>
          <p>Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual  attention.</p>

            <h3>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.  If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>

            <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of the event organizers, or send an email to [email address available during conference] which will be monitored during the course of the conference.</p>
            <p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>
