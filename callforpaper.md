## Topics
We are soliciting talks on computer security topics, but are not limited to the following:

* Security Architecture
* Threat Analysis
* Penetration Testing
* Embedded Security
* Security Tools
* Security Management
* Privacy

All speakers will be given access to speaker mentorship, we especially encourage first time speakers to take advantage of this service. 

## Rookie Speakers
If you are interested in speaking at an infosec conference about a topic that's dear to you, here's your chance! Just add a short rookie note to your cfp submission and we'll gladly help you along the way.

BSidesMunich 2018 will have two stages, a main stage and a smaller rookie stage, so you don't have to worry about being in the spot light too much. The infosec community is full of smart people but speaking doesn't come easy to all of us, so we're here to encourage and support those who have doubts or a hard time deciding whether they should go for it or not. If you have something you want to talk about, submit it, even if you're not sure if it will be a good enough fit for the conference.

> to be frank, *our* job is to figure out what topics will fit, your job is to describe what you're passionate about. we'll figure out if we can make it fit. don't self-select out. :) – [@getify](https://twitter.com/getify/status/940303263441850369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
