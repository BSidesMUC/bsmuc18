Whether you are beginning your career in InfoSec or are a seasoned professional in InfoSec (as I am) working in this field is exciting and invigorating but at the same time can be stressful, hard and could potentially burn you out.  I am going to talk about how do we recognize that we have had enough, why did we originally join the InfoSec community, and what can we do to overcome it. In my many years working in InfoSec I have experienced some of the burnout and many colleagues have too. So, I want to bring awareness to the topic to let "OUR" community know you are not alone.
