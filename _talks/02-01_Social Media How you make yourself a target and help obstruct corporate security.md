    bio: "I have a bachelors degree in Psychology and a masters in Business, earned with distinction. However, I had come across social engineering about 8 years ago, and since then it had been my passion and goal to end up in a career in cyber security. The past few years, I work with Cyber Risk GmbH, a provider of cyber security training programs for companies and corporations. Currently, I am part of a team of experts that is developing enterprise wide social engineering training programs. My deep passion for psychology has helped me in being able to decode and understand social engineering tactics, patters and strategies. My experience in a company providing training helps me in being able to educate & train people on social engineering and assist in attack prevention and attack response incidents."

In today's world, online presence is important. Social networking profiles can create a competitive advantage for many organizations and individuals. However, despite the benefits, a strong online presence can also become a great vulnerability. Christina Lekati, a social engineering expert, will explain how the online presence of a company's employees on social media can attract social engineers to target them, and then use them as “open doors” through the organizational security. The talk will cover the topic of information gathering through social media (information gathering is the most common denominator in every social engineering attack) and explain how even seemingly innocent information can be exploited and used to manipulate targets. The talk includes a two-part demonstration on how a hacker's mind works when harvesting information on social media; The first part includes real examples of posts that expose vulnerabilities, attract attackers and ultimately lead to security breaches. The second part includes a demonstration on how the information one provides online are gathered, categorized, analyzed and then used to craft an attack, as well as how one ends up revealing online more than he intends to. The talk closes with practical recommendations and best practices. Keep in mind, that the purpose on this talk is not to turn people away from using online platforms but rather, to teach them how to use them responsibly. In security, training and awareness can be the catalytic factor between a successful or an unsuccessful attack attempt.
