New vulnerabilities come at astonishing rate of hundreds per day. Some of them get fixed without even being acknowledged. Tracking for known vulnerabilities in a product can be a daunting task. In this presentation I'll explain how genua deals with this task keeping high-security products fixed asap. I'll showcase an open-source tool we've built internally for this reason and teach you how to use it too!
