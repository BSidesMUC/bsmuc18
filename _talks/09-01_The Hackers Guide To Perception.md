When we're talking and thinking about security, we very often have a rather fixed mindset and keep using what we think are proven methods. We tend not to question our decisions and thoughts, and the way how our brains work reaffirms our biases and sometimes mediocre choices. It seems that the one person who is constantly confusing you with Jedi mind tricks is, very often, yourself. 

In this talk we take a closer look at how we are thinking, and how we can change or expand this as well as our perception, by hacking into our own brains in order to get a better picture of what we really want and need. Being able to creatively think in new ways can be a vital new asset for blue and red teams.
