This is an extended version of the Reversing Workshop that was provided at MUC:SEC last september. The workshop is designed as a “hands-on” event that provides a general introduction to this topic by reversing several small “crackmes”. 

Unlike in the last workshop, we will use the free IDA version instead of Binary Ninja, which allows us to cover x64 assembly. We will also have a look at decompilers.

## Course outline:
- Introduction 
- Tool Overview (Command Line Tools, IDA, GDB with pwndbg, RetDec Decompiler, Hex Editors)
- x86/x64 Assembler Crash Course
- Function Calls and Calling Conventions 
- Debugging Symbols and Binary Stripping 
- Common Code Patterns and their Assembly Counterparts
- Binary patching
- Pratical Exercises and Crackmes


## Requirements:
Participants must bring a Laptop that is capable of running a Linux VM (2 GB RAM, 6 GB HD). VMware and Virtual Box are supported. Having a two-button mouse helps but is not required.
