Bro is an open-source Network Security Monitor (NSM) and analytics platform. Even though it has been around since the mid 90's, its main user base was primarily universities, research labs and supercomputing centers. In the past few years however, more and more security professionals in the industry turned their attention to this powerful tool, as it runs on commodity hardware, thus providing a low-cost alternative to commercial solutions.

At its core, Bro inspects traffic and creates extensive set of well-structured, tab-separated log files that record a network’s activity. Nonetheless, Bro is a lot more than just a traditional signature-based IDS. While it supports such standard functionality as well, Bro’s scripting language allows security analysts to perform arbitrary analysis tasks such as extracting files from sessions, detecting malware by interfacing with external source, detecting brute-forcing, etc. It comes with a large set of pre-built standard libraries, just like Python.

## Overview
During this two-hour workshop, we will learn about Bro's capabilities and cover the following topics:
- Introduction to Bro
- Bro architecture
- Bro events and logs
- Bro signatures
- Bro scripting
- Bro and ELK

## Requirements:
- A laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM and more than 30 GB of free disk space
- VMWare Workstation or VMWare Player installed
