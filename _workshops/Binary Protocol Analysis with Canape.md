Canape is a arbitrary network protocol analysis tool that speeds up the reversing process by providing a graphical GUI for easy packet inspection and manipulation. It takes the “web application testing paradigm” that many penetration testers know from tools like Burp and applies it to binary protocols.

Canape is a powerful tool, however it lacks of documentation, making it difficult for new users to start. This “hands-on” workshop is based on the material from the 44CON workshop by James Forshaw (the creator of Canape) and provides a overview of the tool and its possibilities. We will use Canape to analyze a small client-/server application.

## Requirements:
Students must have working Windows system (7/8/10), Virtual Machines are fine. Having a two-button mouse helps but is not required.
