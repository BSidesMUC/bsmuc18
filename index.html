          <p>BSidesMunich is the premiere, independently organized computer security event in the Munich, Germany area, bringing together both local and internationally renowned experts.  As an offshoot of our Meetup group, MUC:SEC, this conference extends our goals of bringing local computer security professionals together, exchanging ideas and experience and most importantly, establishing trust relationship within our community. This event is free.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/">Security BSides</a> events are hosted all over the world and are community driven conferences. This also means that the conference will be what every attendee makes of it. So the success of the event will depend on your active participation, give a talk (in English), create a workshop, design a challenge for other attendees, help with the CTF or sponsoring.</p>
