          <p>To ensure the best talks available are presented at AppSec Europe we are incorporating blind reading as part of our process. This means that names and job titles will be removed when the paper abstract is being reviewed. All speakers will be given access to speaker mentorship, we especially encourage first time speakers to take advantage of this service.</p>
